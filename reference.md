class
:	Represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type

command
:	An instruction telling a computer program to perform a specific task.

comment
:	Text written in a script that is not treated as code to be run, but rather as text that describes what the code is doing. These are usually short notes, often beginning with a # (in many programming languages, R included)

data frame
:	A two-dimensional data structure for storing tabular data in memory. Rows represent records and columns represent variables(vectors).

double
:	Short for “double-precision floating-point number”, meaning a 64-bit numeric value with a fractional part and an exponent.

integer
:	A number that can be written without a fractional component

list
:	A vector that can contain values of many different (heterogeneous) types.

mock data
:	fictional data which is artificially inserted into a piece of software.

:	A symbol that tells the programm to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result

output
:	The result given by the program to the user.

R (Programming language)
:	A popular open-source programming language used primarily for data science.

Radwips
:	An amazing Japanese rock band. 

Reproducibility
:	The practice of describing and documenting research results in such a way that another researcher or person can re-run the analysis code on the same data to obtain the same result. 

RStudio
:	A software application with integrated facilities for the use of R language 

script
:	Synonymous with program. Sequence of instrutions that is interpreted or carried out by a program.

variable (data)
:	Some attribute of a population that can be measured or observed.

vector (data structure in R)
:	Sequences of elements of the same basic type. Vectors are the fundamental data structure in R
